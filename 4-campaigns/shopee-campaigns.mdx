## Overview

A campaign is a structured group of ads that organizes your advertised products with four levels: campaign (the ad tool container), ad object (individual SKUs), ad placement (where ads appear), and ad creative (for TikTok). You can create various campaign types including Product Ads (GMV Max, Manual), Shop Ads, Brand Ads (Search, Homepage), and Live Ads. Key features include automated budget distribution and status management to optimize your ad performance.

## What is a campaign

A campaign is a structured group of ads (ad objects). It serves as a container that defines how you group your advertised products. Think of it as a folder holding your ad objects (SKUs), their rules, and optimization settings.

## Campaign structure

<ResponseField name="Campaign level">
  This is the highest level of the ad structure, housing all ad units within it. Campaigns are matched 1-to-1 with ad tools (e.g., Shopee GMV Max, Lazada Sponsored Discovery, TikTok In-Feed). Inside, you group SKUs/ad objects with a common purpose (e.g., top sellers, new launching products).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ad object level">
  The next level down under campaigns are ad objects, the product (SKU) level. This is the item that you are choosing to advertise. This may include other ad objects such as Shop Ads.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ad placement level">
  This is the lowest level of ads on Epsilo, where your item will be advertised. This location can be explicit such as a specific keyword placement, or a more general placement like discovery or automated.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ad creative level">
  This applies for TikTok Shop campaigns where you manage the creatives/videos that are running on your campaigns.
